    // Basic Problem:
    /*
        **For the following problem, consider that an ArrayList can store
        ArrayLists objects**
        Consider the following scenario:
        You are building a database of information that is organized into many
        different categories (ex: one list might contain all sporting good items
        in your inventory, while another contains all food items). As a part of
        your data management, you want to organize each of these data structures
        under one larger data structure - specifically, you want each ArrayList 
        to be listed in order of size, from largest to smallest in another 
        ArrayList that contains all of the others (perhaps to be able to see at 
        a glance what your overall inventory looks like).
        
        Create two methods:
            (1) A method that adds an ArrayList<String> to an ArrayList of array
                lists!
            (2) Another method that takes the above ArrayList of array lists and
                sorts by size from largest to smallest.
        
    
    */
    
    
    //Extension Problem:
    /*
        Extend the functionality of the data structures created above by adding
        two more methods to organize the data.
    
        (1) A method that accepts an Int as a parameter called 'listSize'.
            The method should remove from the master array list any contained
            array lists with a size less than the 'listLength'
        (2) A method that accepts an int as a parameter called 'listSize' and
            that returns a new ArrayList of array lists that includes all of
            the array lists from your master list above the 'listSize' size!
