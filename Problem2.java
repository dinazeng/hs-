        // Basic Problem:
    /* 
        This problem MUST implement regular arrays (no ArrayList)
    
        In these problems you are going to create some of the functionality of
        an ArrayList using normal arrays.
    
        Create the following 2 methods, both of which require you to manually update
	array sizes:
            (1) A method called 'addElement' that accepts 3 parameters: an 
                array of String, an array index, and a String to add to the array.
                The method should return a new array of Strings with the extra
                String added successfully.
            (2) A method called 'removeElement' that accepts 2 parameters: an
                arary of Strings and the index of the array element to remove.
                The method should return a new array of Strings with the requested
                element removed.
    
    */
    
    
    
    // Extension Problem:
    /*
        This problem MUST implement regular arrays (no ArrayList)
    
        Also create the following 2 methods:
            (1) A method called 'replaceAll' that accepts three parameters: an
                array of Strings, a String you will be searching for, and a 
                String that will replace each of the found entries. The method
                should return a new array with each relevant entry replaced
                successfully.
            (2) A method called 'removeAll' that accepts two parameters: an array
                of Strings and a String that you will be searching for in the array.
                The method should search through the array and remove every entry
                that matches the input String, returning a new array with all
                found elements fully removed!
 
                *tip: You are allowed to reference methods from part 1 as a part
                        of your solution.
