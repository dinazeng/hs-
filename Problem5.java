    // Basic Problem:
    /*
        You are going to be creating a prototype of the game "Battleship"
	Here is how Battleship works for our purposes:
	(1) The player is shown an empty grid (normally 10x10) 
	(2) Hidden on the grid are 'ships' of various lengths
	(3) The player guesses a coordinate to attack
	(4) If the player 'hits' a ship, they are shown an X, but if
	    they miss, they are shown a 'O'
	(5) Once they have destroyed all of the targets, they win!
	*** FOR THIS BASIC PROBLEM, YOU DON'T NEED A WIN CONDITION ***

	Your task:
	Get the prototype of the Battleship game up and running! Here is
	what you need to build:
	-A printout of the current grid state after each attack (you should
	use "-" for unchecked spots, "X" for hits, and "O" for misses)
	-The option for the user to choose the coordinates for their next attack
	-Some functionality that allows this 'checking' for a hit to happen
	automatically (tip: Creating two 2D arrays, one for the player guesses
	and the other to store the actual locations of ships that you can
	compare to one another)
	-You should have ships of different sizes and orientations. Try to have
	at least one ship that is ...
		-2 elements long
		-3 elements long
		-4 elements long
		-5 elements long
		-horizontal
		-vertical

    //Extension Problem:
    /*
        Extend the functionality of the battleship game made above by adding in:
	(1) A win contidion that is triggered once all targets have been hit
	(2) A report on how many tries it took to hit all targets
    */

    //Super Extension Problem:
    /*
	If you want to really impress me, consider creating the ability to have 
	new maps auto-generated once a new round begins
